# obs-gtasa-volume-adjuster 0.1
Adjusts GTA San Andreas volume automatically to avoid playing copyrighted music. The script only mutes the game if special audio zones are loaded (ie, casino backround music, stadium race songs).

# Notice

Only tested in OBS 22.0.2. It works only in OBS **32-bit** with administrator privileges!

# How to install

1. Start OBS.
2. Open Tools -> Scripts.
3. Add the script by pressing + button.

# Settings

# Extra

The script reads/writes game's memory. Use it only if you're sure

To-do:
* Add option to mute obs source instead of the game
* Automatic version detection
* Support radios (?)
